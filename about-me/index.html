                        Hello! I'm Alex, a lifelong gaming enthusiast turned developer, whose love for the craft began with a
                        Gameboy Advance at age four and culminated in a First-Class &#40;Honours&#41; degree in Computer
                        Science &#40;Games Technology&#41; from Kingston University.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        I have loved video games for as long as I can remember. At age 7, I got lucky as my primary school were
                        upgrading their computers, so they literally gave them away for free. Some of my favourite games while
                        growing up were generally older games &#40;since it wasn't exactly a strong PC&#41; like Heroes of
                        Might and Magic 3, Morrowind, and eventually Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura &#40;a full list
                        of <a href="/blog/gamesIRecommend.html">games I recommend</a>&#41;.
                        
                        <br><br>

                        While at Kingston, I honed my game design and programming skills through various projects, like
                        developing VR game <a href="/projects/games/bearGrills/">Bear Grills</a> and mobile game
                        <a href="/projects/games/cosmonaut/">Cosmonaut</a> (a full list of
                        <a href="/other/projectsIDidAtUniversity/">Projects I did at University</a>). Each of these
                        projects helped me to gain experience in different areas, from learning to collaborate as a team to
                        tackling the challenges of leadership itself.

                        <br><br>

                        Beyond game development, I've honed my skills through various programming projects (and online
                        exercises like LeetCode). This includes developing Card Collection Managers for
                        <a href="/other/magicTheGathering/">Magic the Gathering</a> and
                        <a href="/other/yugioh/">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a>, and Character Creators for
                        <a href="/other/dungeonsandDragons(5e)/">Dungeons and Dragons &#40;5th
                        Edition&#41;</a> and <a href="/other/pathFinder(1eAnd2e)/">PathFinder &#40;
                        1st and 2nd Edition&#41;</a>. Through these, I've gained proficiency in the Qt framework, and database
                        scripting with MongoDB and SQLite.

                        <br><br>
                        
                        I'm far more passionate about using my skills to create immersive, engaging game experiences however.
                        My goal is to learn real game design from the experts, and hopefully produce my own indie game. I'm
                        excited to bring my knowledge and enthusiasm to a professional game studio. I love working on small
                        indie projects in my spare time, but more than anything I want to experience a proper games development
                        environment!
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        When I'm not programming, I express my creativity through drawing, writing, and immersing myself in
                        board/card/video games. These hobbies keep my creative juices flowing and fuel my passion for game
                        development!
                        
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Thank you for visiting my <strike>WebZone</strike> Portfolio. I'm looking forward to the next
                        step in my game dev journey, and hopefully you'll be a part of it!
