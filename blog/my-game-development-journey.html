                    They say every great journey begins with a single step. Mine began with a small plastic device 
                    that would fit in the palm of a four-year-old's hands: a Gameboy Advance. What I didn't know 
                    then was that this moment would spark a lifelong passion that would eventually evolve into a 
                    career pursuit in game development.
                </p>

                <h2>The Early Years: Discovery Through Play</h2>

                <p>
                    My earliest memories of gaming are filled with wonder and discovery. The Gameboy Advance wasn't 
                    just a toy; it was a portal to countless worlds. Each cartridge was a key to a different universe, 
                    whether it was exploring the depths of dungeons, solving puzzles, or embarking on epic adventures.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At age seven, fortune smiled upon me in an unexpected way. My primary school was upgrading their 
                    computer systems, and rather than disposing of the old machines, they gave them away to students. 
                    I was lucky enough to receive one of these computers—a modest machine by today's standards, but 
                    to me, it was a treasure trove of possibilities.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Some of my favourite games while growing up were generally older games since it wasn't 
                    exactly a strong PC—like Heroes of Might and Magic 3, Morrowind, and eventually 
                    Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura."
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    These games weren't just entertainment; they were my first lessons in game design, though I 
                    didn't realize it at the time. Heroes of Might and Magic 3 taught me about strategic thinking 
                    and resource management. Morrowind showed me the power of immersive world-building and open-ended 
                    exploration. Arcanum introduced me to the beauty of complex systems working in harmony.
                </p>

                <h2>The Academic Foundation: Kingston University</h2>

                <p>
                    As I grew older, my casual interest in games began to crystallize into something more serious. 
                    I found myself not just playing games, but thinking about how they worked, why certain mechanics 
                    felt satisfying, and how different design choices affected the player experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This curiosity led me to Kingston University, where I pursued a degree in Computer Science with 
                    a focus on Games Technology. The decision to formalize my education in this field was pivotal—it 
                    transformed my passion from a hobby into a structured pursuit of knowledge and skill.
                </p>

                <h3>University Projects: Learning Through Creation</h3>

                <p>
                    The university years were where theory met practice. Each project was an opportunity to explore 
                    different aspects of game development, from technical implementation to team collaboration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of my most memorable projects was <strong>Bear Grills</strong>, a VR experience where players 
                    take on the role of a bear chef cooking for robot customers. This project taught me valuable 
                    lessons about VR design constraints, user experience in immersive environments, and the unique 
                    challenges of developing for emerging technologies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another significant project was <strong>Battlerots</strong>, a multiplayer game inspired by 
                    Medabots. This was my first serious foray into multiplayer game development, and it opened my 
                    eyes to the complexities of networked gameplay, game balance, and the importance of clear 
                    communication in team-based projects.
                </p>

                <h2>Beyond Games: Expanding Technical Horizons</h2>

                <p>
                    While my heart was set on game development, I recognized the value of broadening my technical 
                    skills. This led me to explore application development, where I created several tools that 
                    reflected my other interests:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Card Collection Managers</strong> for Magic: The Gathering and Yu-Gi-Oh!</li>
                    <li><strong>Character Creators</strong> for Dungeons & Dragons (5th Edition) and Pathfinder (1st and 2nd Edition)</li>
                    <li>Various utility applications using Qt framework</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    These projects served multiple purposes. They allowed me to explore different programming paradigms, 
                    work with databases (MongoDB and SQLite), and most importantly, they scratched my own itch as a 
                    tabletop gaming enthusiast. There's something deeply satisfying about creating tools that you 
                    actually use in your daily life.
                </p>

                <h2>Philosophy and Approach: What Drives My Development</h2>

                <p>
                    Through years of playing, studying, and creating games, I've developed a personal philosophy 
                    about what makes games truly engaging. I believe in:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rich World-Building:</strong> Creating universes that feel lived-in and authentic</li>
                    <li><strong>Character-Driven Narratives:</strong> Stories that resonate on an emotional level</li>
                    <li><strong>Meaningful Player Choice:</strong> Decisions that have genuine consequences</li>
                    <li><strong>Systemic Design:</strong> Mechanics that interact in interesting and emergent ways</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Perhaps most importantly, I've learned that the best games are those that respect the player's 
                    time and intelligence. Every mechanic should serve a purpose, every system should contribute 
                    to the overall experience, and every design decision should be made with the player's enjoyment 
                    in mind.
                </p>

                <h2>Looking Forward: The Next Chapter</h2>

                <p>
                    As I write this, I'm at an exciting crossroads in my journey. With a First-Class Honours degree 
                    under my belt and a portfolio of diverse projects, I'm eager to take the next step: joining a 
                    professional game development studio.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While I love working on personal projects and exploring indie game development, there's something 
                    I'm particularly excited about—experiencing the collaborative environment of a professional game 
                    studio. I want to learn from seasoned developers, contribute to larger-scale projects, and be 
                    part of a team that shares my passion for creating memorable gaming experiences.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "I love working on small indie projects in my spare time, but more than anything I want to 
                    experience a proper games development environment!"
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    The journey from that four-year-old with a Gameboy Advance to where I am today has been filled 
                    with discovery, learning, and growth. But in many ways, I feel like this is just the beginning. 
                    The gaming industry is constantly evolving, new technologies are emerging, and there are always 
                    new challenges to tackle and problems to solve.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Whether I'm working on my next indie project or contributing to a AAA title, the core drive 
                    remains the same: to create experiences that bring joy, wonder, and meaning to players' lives. 
                    After all, that's what those early games did for me, and it's what I hope to give back to the 
                    gaming community.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you for following along on this journey. Here's to the next chapter of adventures in game 
                    development!
